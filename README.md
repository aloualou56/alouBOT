# alouBOT
alouBOT is a minecraft bot that is able to do helpful things.It is coded with mineflayer. He only need worker_treads and node to run.
Before you run the bot make sure to change the IP (By default is set to "localhost"), and the PORT (By default is set to "25565").
If your server's IP is a domain (for example aloualou56.aternos.com) just don't change the PORT.

alouBOT offers commands such as:

_guard (It guards a selected area from hostile mobs)

_list (It tells which items the bot has)

_follow (it follows you everywhere)

_fight (it fights with you)

_attack (it attacks players by playername or hostiles)

_come (it comes to the position of the player without following the player)

_goto (it comes to a specific location with the game's cordinates (x y z) or (x z) or (y))

_avoid (it only avoids entities around it)

_tp (It teleports to you (it needs OP))

_stop (stop actions)

alouBOT features:

-it is able to build to make it way

-it has auto-eating

-protection from other player's commands 


If anyone wants to change something about the code, feel free to make a PULL REQUEST, and I will consider it.
alouBOT may also be updated a couple of times with new features!
