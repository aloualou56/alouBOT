# alouBOT
alouBOT is a minecraft bot that is able to do helpful things.It is coded with mineflayer. He uses NODEJS to run, and npm, which 
comes with npm the most times to install packages.

It needs the following packages to run:

-> debug                 ( npm install debug )                    _command to install the package_

-> minecraft-protocol    ( npm install minecraft-protocol )       _command to install the package_

-> protodef              ( npm install protodef )                 _command to install the package_

-> vec3                  ( npm install vec3 )                     _command to install the package_

-> prismarine-world      ( npm install prismarine-world )         _command to install the package_

-> prismarine-entity     ( npm install prismarine-entity )        _command to install the package_

-> prismarine-physics    ( npm install prismarine-physics )       _command to install the package_

-> mineflayer-pathfinder ( npm install mineflayer-pathfinder )    _command to install the package_

-> mineflayer-utils      ( npm install mineflayer-utils )         _command to install the package_

-> rambda                ( npm install rambda )                   _command to install the package_




Before you run the bot make sure to change the IP (By default is set to "localhost"), and the PORT (By default is set to "25565") in the config.json file.
If your server's IP is a domain (for example aloualou56.aternos.com) just don't change the PORT.


alouBOT offers commands such as:

_guard (It guards a selected area from hostile mobs)

_list (It tells which items the bot has)

_follow (it follows you everywhere)

_fight (it fights with you)

_attack (it attacks players by playername or hostiles)

_come (it comes to the position of the player without following the player)

_goto (it comes to a specific location with the game's cordinates (x y z) or (x z) or (y))

_avoid (it only avoids entities around it)

_tp (It teleports to you (it needs OP))

_stop (stop actions)



alouBOT features:

-it is able to build to make it way

-it has auto-eating

-protection from other player's commands 

-Quiet mode in config.json file (It has 2 options "true" and "false")




If anyone wants to change something about the code, feel free to make a PULL REQUEST, and I will consider it.
alouBOT may also be updated a couple of times with new features!

Please don't copy my project and claim it to be yours. It took me several hours! I don't mind showing it to your friends as yours, but please don't copy it and upload it to Github as your project!

And also my code is somehow making the bot say the same thing 3 times in row when quiet mode is false
